# Product Sense 

## Lesson Objective 
To Teach the use of logic models and product metrics to scope out problems. 

## Learning Target 
Give students three tools to develop problem statements. 
1. Problem Statements 
2. Influence Diagrams 

### Teaching Strategy 
In-direct Instruction and group work 

## Introduction/Steps 
- Provide a motivating business problem to follow all the exercises 
- Ask people how they would get started 

### Teaching Activities 
- How can using data help inform new products or understand problems
Start with motivating product problem from last course and ask how data science could either help validate a hypothesis or model a problem in some way. 

- Influence Diagrams 
- Writing good problem statements

#### Influence Diagrams 
- Show construction in Draw IO 
- Start with dependent and independent variables 
- Ask which data could help be used to get the dependent and independent variables 
- Ask how they data could be derived or flawed in some way 

#### Check for Understanding 
- Write influence diagram based on a data product 
- Understand components of a good problem statement 

## Conclusion 
- Provide template for problem statement 
- Talk about data discovery through data stewards 

### Assessment for Learning 
- Practice problem from business case 
- Group work 
- Show answer 

## Reflection/Highlights 
- Course survey
