# Product Sense 

## Lesson Objective 
To Teach the use of logic models and product metrics to scope out problems. 

## Learning Target 
Give students three tools to develop problem statements. 
1. Logic Models 
2. AARRR Funnel Metrics  
3. Diagnosing Metric Changes 

### Teaching Strategy 
In-direct Instruction and group work 

## Introduction/Steps 
- Provide a motivating business problem to follow all the exercises 
- Ask people how they would get started 

### Teaching Activities 
- Logic Models - examples with Draw IO and how to build 
- AARRR Metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, 'Revenue')
- Putting together Logic Models and AARRR Metrics into a final diagram 
- Assessing root cause issues with metrics  

#### Assessing Root Cause 
- Scope out the Metric Change 
This could mean definition, importance, time frame and magnitude. 
 
- Hypothesize Contributing Factors 
Accidental changes, natural changes, internal changes, and external changes. Could use a modified fishbone diagram 

- Validate Each Hypothesis with More Data 
Uncover evidence and use data to disprove hypotheses 

- Classify Each Factor 
Classify each hypothesis into root cause, contributing, correlated (symptoms of root cause), or unrelated 

#### Check for Understanding 
- Explain the main components of a logic model 
- What are the characteristics of good metrics 

### Assessment for Learning 
- Practice problem from business case 
- Group work 
- Show answer
