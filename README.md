# data_projects_course
Lesson plan and concepts for a course on discovering data projects and products. 

This course might need to be reduced or split into two. The general design is to teach logic models, evaluation and product sense, but to also give approaches to model and think through the problem to start to see potential data or technological solutions. 

## Lesson Objective 
To teach students the basics of product management and how to write great problem statements related to data and analytics. 

## Learning Target 
Give students three tools to develop problem statements. 
1. Product Sense 
2. Object Process Model 
3. End-to-End Thinking 

### Teaching Strategy 
In-direct Instruction and group work 

## Introduction/Steps 
- Provide a motivating problem on a slide 
- Ask how people would get started 

### Teaching Activities 1 - Product Sense 
- "How to find problems" 
- Logic Models 
- Explain product sense 

#### Check for Understanding 
- Explain the main components of a logic model 
- What are the characteristics of good metrics 

### Teaching Activities 2 - OPM  (optional)
- "How to document a new product" 
- Show how to use an object process model (OPM)
- Write the statement from the object process model 

#### Check for Understanding 
- Write a basic OPM model 

### Teaching Activities 3 - Refining through End-to-End Thinking  
- Now explain how to use End-to-End thinking to refine the problem description with possible solutions
- "Do you have the data?" 

#### Check for Understanding 
- Explain steps of end-to-end problem solving 

## Conclusion 
- Provide template for problem statement 
- Talk about data discovery through data stewards 

### Assessment for Learning 
- Practice problem from business case 
- Group work 
- Show answer 

## Reflection/Highlights 
- Course survey
